In the files agn.us.txt, ainv.us.txt, ale.us.txt contain daily stock data of NYSE and NASDAQ from 2005 to 2017
Every line has the structure: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt
Using Apache Spark we have to execute the following queries:

1)Find the average for open, close and volume for every month and every different stock

2)Find the number of days that open value of every stock was above 35 dollars

3)Find the days with highest value on open and volume for every stock
